=====================

Using open datasets to create a historical and predictive visualisations of crowds and their effects.

Pedestrian flow sensors produce a stream of measurments with timestamp and geo location.

One pedestrian flow measurement consists of (nr. pedestrians registered by sensor, geo location of the sensor,
time of the measurement). Location and time can be used to join other datasets, for example weather data 
or sports events like the Olympics that took place in summer of 2012 in London.

We are implementing a platform to store, analyse and visualise sensor data.
